## Vendithera was the second event organized by my college's film making club, Chitrakala on 29th of June, 2024.
### **VENDITHERA** was a really fun event where we screened two of the most cult classic movies, Pokiri and Jalsa in our college's auditorium.

<br/>
For this event to stand out and make it a memorable experience, we planned to make the process of attending the event as close as how a cinema theatre works. 
To make that happen there was a requirement to develop a working seat booking interface for the students to have the feasibility of selecting seats of their choice. 
To fulfill that necessity, I have acted as a Tech Lead for the event and developed a dynamic seat booking interface.

## To do this, the tools I have used are
> Figma
> <br/>
> HTML, CSS and JS


## 1. Figma 
<br/>
First, I have wire framed the intial design that I got and start experimenting with things like, fonts, gradients, components, auto-layout etc. After experimenting with lot's of customizations
 that Figma provides, I came to a final design.

<br/>

## 2. HTML, CSS and JS
</br>
Now after my design is ready, I had to bring the design to life.
